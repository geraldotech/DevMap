# Vue 3 + Vite

- Vue Router 
- Vuex
 - state, getters, mutations, actions
- Pina [coming soon]
- VueMixin 'OptionsAPI' and 'Composition API'
  - Alternative is create .js files in a hooks folder and import when needs
  - In Vue 2, mixins were the primary mechanism for creating reusable chunks of component logic. While mixins continue to be supported in Vue 3, Composable functions using Composition API is now the preferred approach for code reuse between components.
